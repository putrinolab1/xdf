If a stream has the content-type **VideoRaw**, we recommend that meta-data about the stream adheres to the structure and naming laid out in the following. While most meta-data is optional, at least fields width, height, and color\_format under encoding must be present. Colors are not compressed, i.e., one color channel corresponds to a stream channel (e.g., an RGB color pixel takes up 3 channels).

```xml

<encoding>           # specification of how each sample (frame) is encoded
<width>            # width of each sample, in pixels; must be present
<height>           # height of each sample, in pixels; must be present
<color_channels>   # number of channels per pixel (1 for grayscale, 3 for RGB or YUV, 4 for RGBA)
<color_format>     # the color format; typical values are GRAY (grayscale), RGB (red-greed-blue, in that order), RGBA (RGB with additional alpha channel), or YUV (for YÂ´CbCr); must be present
<color_space>      # color space that the video is in, e.g. sRGB; assume sRGB for RGB format if missing
<codec>            # should be present, assume RAW if missing
