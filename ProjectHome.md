XDF (Extensible Data Format) is a general-purpose container format for multi-channel time series data with extensive associated meta-information. XDF is tailored towards biosignal data such as EEG, EMG, EOG, ECG, GSR, MEG, etc., but can easily hold data with high sampling rate (like audio) or high numbers of channels (like fMRI or raw video), as well. Meta-information is stored as XML.

XDF is open source and designed to be a community project; that is, everyone is invited to contribute to the format specification. The core [specification](Specifications.md) of the format is kept as simple as possible, but at the same time rich enough to support features such as time stamp corrections, boundary chunks for seeking, and data streams supporting many different data types (including int, float, double, string).

The XDF concept and beta version was developed by Christian Kothe and Clemens Brunner at the [Swartz Center for Computational Neuroscience (SCCN)](http://sccn.ucsd.edu/) at the [University of California San Diego](http://www.ucsd.edu/), CA, USA. Clemens Brunner is continuing to work on this project at the [Institute for Knowledge Discovery](http://bci.tugraz.at/) at the [Graz University of Technology](http://www.tugraz.at), Graz, Austria.  We welcome input from all interested in contributing.
